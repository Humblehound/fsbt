# fsbt
A fast scala build tool

## About

fsbt is a project aimed to fix all of sbt's shortcomings. Key features:

- simplicity, user friendliness
- speed, thanks to the use of fast scala compiler
- easy of configuration (single file config)
- gradle-like dependency resolving

This project is clearly just starting, as soon as I will establish a solid development and testing framework I shall expand on the features.
